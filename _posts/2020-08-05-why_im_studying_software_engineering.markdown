Once I graduated from college earlier this year, I was stuck in a job market that wasn't hiring and had no real options at that moment. I graduated with a degree in Mathematical Finance, but I wasn't interested in pursuing the finance world. I had taken a couple computer science classes in college, and those planted the seeds in my head to pursue this route. After researching and talking to others I knew that had gone down the same road as me, I chose Flatiron School's online software engineering bootcamp as the stepping stone towards my new career path. As being both a creative type and a analytical and logical thinking person, learning how to create and manipulate websites and apps was a huge draw for me. The front-end coding specifically is very interesting to me, and the growing job market for programmers and software engineers only helped to seal the deal for my decision on a new and exciting career.

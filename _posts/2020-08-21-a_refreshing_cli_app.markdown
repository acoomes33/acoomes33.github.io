After a few pitfalls and missteps, I finished my CLI project with a final product that I could definitely put to use right now, finding the closest brewery near me! Before taking on the task of building an app that helps people find a cold pint of lager nearby, I ran into some struggles with my first idea. At first, I took on the challenge of picking workout exercises based on different body groups, but I quickly found trouble with the data sources. I wasn't able to find a reliable API with the information I needed, and any webpage that I could scrape quickly became complex and mindnumbingly exhausting. I knew I had to switch in order to finish on time, and luckily I stumbled across a brewery API that worked wonderfully. After researching API's, I came away with a at least serviceable understanding of them, and I was able to create a functioning app that goes two levels deep in retrieving information for the user. 

One of the things I learned while working on this project is finding out just how much coding is trial and error, and also perseverance while working out the kinks in the design. I also discovered that setting your mind to go down one specific path is not a good thing, especially when it creates more problems that the original issue was worth. Taking a step back and thinking logically on how our code should work is key to programming and is key for your mental health as well!
